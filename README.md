### Summary

myParx is an app to help users create a Bucket List of US National Parks to visit. Additionally, users can create Packing Lists and associate them with a favorited national park. For example, if a user is going to Yosemite for 2 days, and has previously created a Packing List for a 2-day camping trip, they can associate that packing list with their favorite park. So simple! What a time save.

A searchbar lets Users can search the National Park Service's database of all parks, and easily add a park to their Favorites list from the search result screen.

This project was created over the course of 5 days as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive in Summer/Fall 2021.
